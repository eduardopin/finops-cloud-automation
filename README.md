# Finops Cloud Automation

AWS cost governance automation and FinOps operating practices.

This repository contains public-safe examples and operational guidance for infrastructure, platform engineering, SRE, FinOps and DevSecOps review. It avoids proprietary customer details, credentials, internal hostnames and account-specific identifiers.

## How to Review

Start with the architecture and operating model documents, then inspect the examples and validation workflow. The repository is organized so maintainers can evaluate purpose, safety boundaries, operational value and extension points without needing private environment context.

## Repository Map

- `docs/` - design notes, operational guidance and review material.
- `docs/diagrams.md` - visual diagrams for the FinOps operating loop, data flow and automation model.
- `examples/` - runnable or adaptable examples with placeholder values.
- `scripts/` - small automation helpers intended for local validation.
- `.github/workflows/` - continuous validation and repository hygiene checks.

## Confidentiality

All examples are intentionally generic. Replace placeholders with values from your own environment and review security, compliance and cost impact before use.
